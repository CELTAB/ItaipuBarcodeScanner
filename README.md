A BarcodeScanner that can read severals types of barcodes. Used at Itaipu DAM beside other software to identify informations of some machines.

The core for the barcode scanner is based on [zbarjs](https://github.com/yurydelendik/zbarjs) project.

This project was made using the [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) platform, so it is possible to recompile it and use it into several mobile platforms. It was already tested on android and Windows 8.1.
