# ItaipuBarcodeScanner
A Barcode Scanner that can read several types of barcodes using a smart phone with a camera. It takes a picture of the Barcode and then decodes from the image. It's used at Itaipu DAM beside other software solution to identify informations about some machines using only a barcode tag and a scanner.

The core for the barcode scanner is based on [zbarjs](https://github.com/yurydelendik/zbarjs) project.

This project was made using the [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) platform, so it is possible to recompile it and use it into several mobile platforms. It was already tested on android and Windows 8.1.
